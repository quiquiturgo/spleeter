## Step 1: Install the Instant Terra plugin
 
The first step is to install the Instant Terra plugin for your Unreal Engine version (4.26, 4.27 or 5). You can find the plugin on the Unreal Engine Marketplace: [https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/instant-terra-terrain-generator](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/instant-terra-terrain-generator). After downloading the plugin, enable it in your Unreal Editor and restart it.
 
## Step 2: Initialize your terrain in Unreal Engine
 
The next step is to initialize your terrain in Unreal Engine. To do this, click on the Instant Terra button on the toolbar and select "Create new landscape". A window will pop up where you can choose the size and resolution of your landscape based on Unreal Engine's recommendations. You can also name your landscape and choose a folder to save it. After clicking "Create", a new landscape will be created in your scene.
 
## Step 3: Edit your terrain in Instant Terra
 
Now you can edit your terrain in Instant Terra. To launch Instant Terra from Unreal Editor, click on the Instant Terra button on the toolbar and select "Edit landscape". A new window will open where you can see your terrain as a node graph. You can add nodes to modify your terrain, such as noise, erosion, slope, mask, etc. You can also use the integrated world browser to download any part of the world in one click. For more information on how to use Instant Terra, you can check the documentation: [https://instantterrapro.wysilab.com/instant-terra-unreal-engine-plugin-documentation/](https://instantterrapro.wysilab.com/instant-terra-unreal-engine-plugin-documentation/).
 
## Step 4: Define your landscape layers in Instant Terra
 
One of the cool features of the Instant Terra plugin is that you can define your landscape layers in Instant Terra and assign a mask for each layer. This way, you can control how your textures are applied to your terrain. To do this, click on the Layers tab in Instant Terra and add as many layers as you want. You can name each layer and choose a texture for it. Then, you need to connect a mask node to each layer node. The mask node defines where the layer is visible on the terrain. You can use any node that outputs a grayscale image as a mask node, such as slope, altitude, noise, etc.
 
## Step 5: Send your terrain and layers to Unreal Engine
 
The final step is to send your terrain and layers to Unreal Engine. To do this, just click on the "Send to Unreal" button on the toolbar in Instant Terra. The plugin will automatically update your landscape heightmap and create a landscape material with all the layers and textures you defined in Instant Terra. You can then edit the landscape material in Unreal Engine if you want.
 
That's it! You have successfully created and edited your Unreal Engine landscape with Instant Terra plugin. You can easily iterate on
