## How to Use Omnic Software
 
Once you have installed Omnic software on your computer, you can launch it from the Start menu or the desktop icon. You will see the main window of the software, which consists of several panels and menus. Here are some of the basic features and functions of Omnic software:
 
- The **Data Collection** panel allows you to set up and run your experiments. You can choose from various types of experiments, such as single scan, background correction, kinetics, TGA-IR, GC-IR and SPR. You can also adjust the parameters of your experiment, such as scan range, resolution, number of scans, interval and trigger mode.
- The **Data Browser** panel shows you the list of data files that you have collected or opened. You can select any file to view its spectrum or spectra in the **Spectrum Display** panel. You can also rename, delete, copy or move your files using the right-click menu.
- The **Spectrum Display** panel shows you the graphical representation of your data. You can zoom in or out, pan, scale or change the units of your spectrum using the toolbar buttons or the mouse wheel. You can also overlay multiple spectra, add annotations, markers or cursors, or perform basic operations such as baseline correction, smoothing or peak picking.
- The **Data Processing** panel allows you to apply various advanced algorithms and methods to your data. You can perform spectral subtraction, normalization, deconvolution, derivative, integration, curve fitting or multivariate analysis. You can also create custom formulas or macros to automate your data processing tasks.
- The **Data Analysis** panel helps you interpret your data and extract meaningful information. You can compare your spectra with reference libraries, identify unknown compounds, quantify components or monitor changes over time. You can also generate reports, charts or tables to present your results.
