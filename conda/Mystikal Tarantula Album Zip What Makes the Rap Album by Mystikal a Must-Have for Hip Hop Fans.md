## Production
  
One of the strengths of Tarantula is its diverse and high-quality production, which matches Mystikal's energy and charisma. The album features beats from Rockwilder, Scott Storch, The Medicine Men and The Neptunes, who provide a range of sounds from funky to gritty to futuristic.
  
Rockwilder, who produced Mystikal's hit single "Danger (Been So Long)" from his previous album Let's Get Ready, contributes three tracks to Tarantula: "If It Ain't Live, It Ain't Me", "Settle The Score" and "I Get It Started". These tracks showcase Rockwilder's signature hard-hitting drums and catchy hooks.
  
Scott Storch, who was rising to fame as a producer for artists like Dr. Dre and Eve at the time, also delivers three tracks: "Tarantula", "P\*\*\*y Crook" and "That's That S\*\*\*". These tracks feature Storch's trademark piano melodies and synth bass lines, creating a smooth and seductive vibe.
  
The Medicine Men, formerly known as Beats by the Pound, are a production team that worked extensively with No Limit Records in the late 90s. They produce four tracks on Tarantula: "Big Truck Driver", "Smoke One", "Alright" and "The Return". These tracks have a southern flavor with heavy bass and bounce.
  
The Neptunes, who were dominating the charts with their innovative production for artists like Nelly, Jay-Z and Britney Spears at the time, produce two tracks on Tarantula: "Bouncin' Back (Bumpin' Me Against The Wall)" and "Go 'Head". These tracks showcase The Neptunes' signature minimalist and futuristic sound, with sparse drums and quirky synths.
  
## Features
  
Tarantula also boasts an impressive lineup of guest appearances from some of the most popular and respected artists in the hip-hop industry. The album features collaborations with Juvenile, Butch Cassidy, Method Man & Redman, Shonnie and Mystikal's fellow No Limit soldiers.
